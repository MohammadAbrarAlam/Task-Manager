## ✨ Project Highlights

This Task Manager is designed with simplicity and clarity in mind.  
It provides a clean user experience while demonstrating the fundamental concepts required to build a full-stack web application using Flask.

The application follows a structured architecture where:

- Flask handles routing and backend logic
- SQLAlchemy manages database interactions
- Jinja2 templates render dynamic content
- Bootstrap cards create a modern and responsive UI

Despite being a beginner-friendly project, it reflects real-world development practices such as modular code structure, ORM usage, and deployment readiness.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

This project is a practical implementation of:

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- MVC-like project structure in Flask
- Template inheritance using Jinja2 (`base.html`)
- Database modeling with SQLAlchemy
- Responsive design using Bootstrap
- Preparing a Flask app for production deployment (Gunicorn + Render)

## 🎨 User Interface

The UI is built using **Bootstrap Cards** and custom CSS effects to provide:

- Smooth hover animations
- Clean layout and spacing
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Visual distinction for completed tasks

## 📈 Why This Project Matters

This project is ideal for students and beginners who want to:

- Strengthen Flask fundamentals
- Understand how backend connects with frontend
- Learn how databases integrate into web apps
- Deploy Python web applications to the cloud for free

It serves as a strong foundation for building more advanced Flask applications like Todo apps, note apps, or project management systems.
